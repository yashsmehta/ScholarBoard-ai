2. Core Research Questions
Dr. DiCarlo's research aims to:
• Understand how the brain's ventral visual stream processes images to enable rapid and accurate object recognition
• Discover the neural computations that transform retinal inputs into high-level object representations
• Develop computational models that can predict and explain neural responses in the visual cortex
• Explore how visual experience shapes and refines object recognition capabilities

3. Major Contributions
Dr. DiCarlo is recognized for:
• Developing engineering-level models of primate visual object recognition
• Demonstrating that populations of neurons in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex rapidly convey explicit representations of object identity
• Showing how carefully designed visual recognition tests can discover high-performing bio-inspired algorithms
• Revealing how the ventral stream's object recognition abilities are rapidly reshaped by natural visual experience

4. Current Research / Ongoing Projects
• Building and testing computational models as leading scientific hypotheses of ventral stream neural mechanisms
• Utilizing models to non-invasively modulate neural activity patterns deep in the brain
• Testing models using direct neural perturbations (e.g., optogenetics, chemogenetics)
• Exploring how ventral stream mechanisms might develop from unsupervised biological visual experience
• Developing brain-machine interfaces for restoring or augmenting lost senses

5. Methodology and Approach
• Large-scale neurophysiology in awake, behaving non-human primates
• Functional brain imaging (fMRI)
• Human psychophysics
• Computational modeling and simulations

• High-throughput screening of artificial neural network architectures

6. Research Beliefs / Philosophy
Dr. DiCarlo believes that:
• The human mind is an emergent phenomenon of the brain that can be understood in engineering terms
• Visual intelligence arises from machine-like processes in the brain that can be emulated artificially
• Interdisciplinary approaches combining neuroscience, computer science, and engineering are crucial for understanding and replicating human visual intelligence
• Precise computational models are essential for predicting neural responses and guiding experimental design
