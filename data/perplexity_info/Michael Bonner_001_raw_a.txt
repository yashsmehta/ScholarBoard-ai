• Subdisciplines: Visual information processing, neural representations, deep learning models, high-dimensional brain representations

2. Core Research Questions
• How is visual information processed and represented in biological systems?
• What are the core statistical principles governing visual representation in the brain?
• How can we understand the full complexity of high-dimensional human brain representations?
• What are the computational and neural underpinnings of biological vision?

3. Major Contributions
Dr. Bonner is recognized for:
• Revealing that neural representations are intrinsically high-dimensional, challenging traditional views of low-dimensional neural representations
• Developing new theoretical perspectives and methods to understand complex brain representations
• Advancing understanding of the intersection between neuroscience, AI, and computational vision
• Uncovering similarities between artificial and biological vision systems using novel statistical approaches

4. Current Research / Ongoing Projects
• Exploring uncharted dimensions of human brain representation (with Dr. Brice Menard)
• Investigating canonical representations of artificial and biological vision
• Studying high-performing computational models of visual cortex marked by high intrinsic dimensionality
• Examining emergent selectivity for scenes, object properties, and contour statistics in feedforward models of scene-preferring cortex

5. Methodology and Approach
• Combines neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) with computational modeling
• Utilizes advanced imaging techniques and deep learning models
• Employs high-dimensional data analysis and statistical methods
• Uses both laboratory experiments and online behavioral studies (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk)

6. Research Beliefs / Philosophy
Dr. Bonner believes in pushing neuroscience research beyond traditional characterizations of neural representations. He emphasizes the importance of understanding high-dimensional brain operations and advocates for new theoretical perspectives to comprehend the full complexity of human brain representations.
