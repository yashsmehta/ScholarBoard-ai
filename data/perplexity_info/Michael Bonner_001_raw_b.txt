• How can we develop new theoretical perspectives and methods to understand the full complexity of human brain representations?

3. Major Contributions
Dr. Bonner is recognized for:
• Revealing that neural representations in the visual cortex are intrinsically high-dimensional, challenging traditional views of low-dimensional neural coding
• Demonstrating that higher-dimensional representations in deep neural networks better predict cortical responses and improve learning of new stimuli
• Developing novel computational approaches to analyze large-scale neural datasets and high-dimensional representations
• Advancing our understanding of the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses to affordance properties in visual scenes

4. Current Research / Ongoing Projects
• Investigating the latent semantic content of visual representations using computational models
• Exploring uncharted dimensions of human brain representation through data-intensive computing
• Studying the neural coding of navigational affordances in visual scenes
• Examining the relationship between natural scene statistics and human visual perception
• Developing large-scale, naturalistic datasets of social actions for computational modeling
