2. Core Research Questions
Dr. Bonner's research aims to uncover the core statistical principles governing visual representation in the brain. Specific questions include:
• How are visual representations organized in high-dimensional neural space?
• What are the computational and neural mechanisms underlying biological vision?
• How do artificial neural networks compare to biological visual systems?
• How can we develop new theoretical perspectives and methods to understand the full complexity of human brain representations?

3. Major Contributions
Dr. Bonner is recognized for:
• Revealing that neural representations in the visual cortex are intrinsically high-dimensional, challenging traditional views of low-dimensional neural coding
• Demonstrating that higher-dimensional representations in deep neural networks better predict cortical responses and improve learning of new stimuli
• Developing novel computational approaches to analyze large-scale neural datasets and model visual processing

4. Current Research / Ongoing Projects
• Investigating the latent semantic content of visual representations using computational models
• Exploring the relationship between intrinsic dimensionality and performance in neural network models of visual cortex
• Studying the neural coding of navigational affordances in visual scenes
• Examining the co-occurrence statistics of vision and language in object representations

5. Methodology and Approach
Dr. Bonner employs a multi-modal approach combining:
• Advanced neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, EEG)
• Computational modeling, particularly deep learning and convolutional neural networks
• Large-scale behavioral experiments
• Statistical analysis of high-dimensional neural data
• Development of novel dimensionality reduction and visualization techniques

6. Research Beliefs / Philosophy
Dr. Bonner believes in the importance of integrating neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and computational vision to gain a comprehensive understanding of visual processing. He emphasizes the need for new theoretical perspectives and methods to capture the full complexity of neural representations, moving beyond traditional low-dimensional models.
